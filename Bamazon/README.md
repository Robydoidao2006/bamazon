we were asked to create an amazon type of store, in which  
there would be roughly 10 items. the items comes from a table on mysqlworkbench along with mamp, I had to first established a solid 
local connection via Port. Then I created a function that would display all the information(items on the shop) on the terminal. created another function that would validade the user input, making sure the user is only able to use numbers. next is the prompt, which will asked the user what item is he interested on, and how many units does he need. last, I made a .then function that would  subtract the amount of items the user bought to the total amount we had on store, it would also cancell the order if it surpasses the amount of items we have available and it would also display the total amount the costumer owns the store. 


This assignment was very challenging, the hardest part was finding a way to subtract the amount of items the user bought from the total amount we have on store, and keep track of the remainder.
